 NEWS/ChangeLog for RedeR
--------------------------

 1.0.4		2012-02-01

  BUG FIXES
    o Improved graph loading time via xml serialization, data packing and post formats for RedeR.
    o Improved stability between server/client connection.
    o Improved control over the app main features.

 1.00		2011-11-01	[1st public release in Bioconductor]

  NEW FEATURES
    o Improved settings for nested objects (parent, gscale, and gcoord features).
    o Improved interface, better connection between R and Java.
    o Improved uploading speed.
    o Added a pre-processed dataset to demonstrate the package in the upcoming case studies.  
    o Container status now can be set to transparence.
    o Graphs can be printed using local PDF and PostScript printers 
      (for better quality).
    o Nodes can be assigned to containers 
      (to allow subnetworks with overlapping nodes)
    o Graphs can be added to the current session also via app.
    o Improved I/O routines and interactivity.
    o Improved static and dynamic layouts for containers.
    o New method to send series of graphs to RedeR.
    o New method to duplicate graphs and subgraphs in a network.
    o New method to nest graphs and subgraphs in a network.
    o New method to nest hclust objects in a network.
    o "RedeR" is set as the final name for the "dyNet-RDyNet" project.

  BUG FIXES
    o Some routines are more simplified for easier maintenance.
    o PostScript corrected for R interface.
    o Arrows set to large edges.
    o Zoom of nested objects now returns to default after released.  
    o Synchronization of dynamic layout is fixed for dense networks.
    o Data loading/transfer via xmlrpc protocol is set for better performance.
    o KK layout algorithm was removed due to unresolved 3rd part exceptions.
    o Improvements on several features in both R and Java side of the package.
